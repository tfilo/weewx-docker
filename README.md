# Weewx in docker image (unofficial)

This is just simple image Dockerfile definition to include weewx instalation, it is based on python as base image. It is already preconfigured with timezone and LANG, as my primary goal is to use it in my personal server. If you like it should be possible to override this by setting environments in docker compose but i didn't test it.

Information about weewx software can be found on it's official website: https://weewx.com/
