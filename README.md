# Weewx in docker image

This is just simple image Dockerfile definition to include weewx instalation, it is based on python as base image. It is already preconfigured with timezone and LANG, as my primary goal is to use it in my personal server. If you like it shoudl be possible to override this by setting environmens in docker compose but i didn't test it.
